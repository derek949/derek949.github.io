 I think I am starting to really like just about everything about this class. The way Downing lectures is very interactive and never feels like a burden to go to lecture. As I have been doing the project for the class, I’m starting to feel like C++ is getting much more manageable. As a novice at git, I’ve found that managing the files and using the terminal to manage git branches is very confusing. I’ve spent a lot of time googling how to branch and learning what it actually means to switch branches.  So far, I don’t believe the project Collatz is that different conceptually but having to understand how to do everything and following all the steps have seemed a bit daunting.  I personally used a virtual box from home and I think it was a lot more difficult than just going to the lab and using the lab’s resources. I may have also had problems doing my own set up at home because I’m not used to using virtual machines and setting up the virtual machine also took quite some time and googling. Overall, I believe Downing really knows what he’s talking about when it comes to the software engineering world and I feel like what I’ve learned so far either from the class or just on my own is going to be very helpful when I go into the professional world.

My tip of the week is to try to learn as much as you can about how github works and what commands to use. Also being an expert at using terminal is very useful for doing not only the coding projects but also learning how to manage this online blog.
