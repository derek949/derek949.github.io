 This week professor Downing invited a guest speaker, one of his former students, to come speak about working in the real world. I thought I learned a lot about the different programs and the way software companies operate. A big thing that stood out to me was that he said software companies use a whole array of different programming languages, I always thought that a company limits itself to only a handful of languages to make code more universally understood. Another interesting thing that he said was that his company, Bloomberg, had a very open office type of setting. What I've seen in a couple places I've visited is that they have cubicles or at least their own actual place to work but at Bloomberg the entire building is your office. 
 
 Project 1 ended up being a bit stressful to finish, the coding itself was not very strenuous but the process of completing all the requirements was extremely tedious. From using Travis CI to learning how to use DOxygen was fairly confusing and I felt that there wasnt enough thorough explanation on what we had to do for DOxygen. I think it really helps with real world work though because there are many things a programmer has to do to make sure there's correct documentation and that their code is for sure to work in practice. As of now, Downing's class still is very enjoyable and I hope it stays this way. I enjoy the amount of detail to finishing up a project and would like to learn more about how to professionally submit code.
